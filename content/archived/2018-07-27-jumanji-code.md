Jumanji code creeps out of your machine, follows you home, and keeps you up at night. 

You give up and close your laptop, thinking you're done for the day. But as you approach the door, you hear a rattling sound coming from your desk behind you. You turn your head. Nothing. It's just your laptop, cold and still. You exit and unbeknownst to you, all the evil spirits of type errors and exceeded maximum call stacks you actually allowed to be executed on your faithful, excellently crafted machine and dev tools nest into your shadow and cling to your scalp, burrowing deep into your skull. And as the night wears on, the jungle grows around you and envelopes your environs, and the monsters come out in hypnagogic code.

You see familiar code morphing into unintelligible characters. You see a figure walking down the hallway and when it gets through the doorway, it disappears and reappears exactly where it started. This happens again and again. And there's nothing you can do to stop it, even though you know you should. But there's no keyboard in front of you, no <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>. 

You see the familiar Google search input before you. Someone is typing into it. The results come back. They click through the first few results. There's a NPM package on GitHub. You're reading through the documentation. It's exactly what you were looking for. It inexplicably solves all your problems. You open your eyes and reach for your phone. You type in the same query. It's not there. Not quite. You begin reading through the results. Yes! That's it. No....no....nevermind. You close your eyes. Now you're searching for an error message that doesn't exist anywhere in Stack Overflow or GitHub issues. You're completely on your own. You don't even know what to do.

Jumanji code persists. You caused the universe to shift off its axis and there's something that you need to do to make it right, but you have no clue what it is.

You begin to catalog the bugs. Every time you see an error in your terminal or console, you write down its name. You draw the monster with its bulging insect eyes and many legs in thick black marker. You pin it to your bug collection like a trophy. You move on.
